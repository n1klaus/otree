            You are in a group of {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} people.
            Player 1 is endowed with KSH 200 and 
            will be asked to choose any amount
            between KSH 0 and KSH 200 to send to Player 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player 3 sees the amount that Player 1 has decided
            to send to Player 2 and from this, 
            he will decide to either Punish or Not Punish Player 1.
        </li>
        <li>
            If Player 3 decides to punish the offer,
            both Player 1 and Player 2 will not receive any payout.
        </li>
        <li>
            If Player 3 decides not to punish the offer,
            the payout for Player 1 will be KSH 200 - the offer amount
            and Player 2 will receive the amount that Player 1 decided 
            to send him.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player 1 and Player 2 will be shown their payouts
            in the results page.
